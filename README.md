ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Pallab
I'm a 19-year-old student and passionate programmer currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA). I have a strong foundation in Python, and Iâ€™m actively expanding my skills in Java, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and 8085 Assembly Language. I love exploring how technology shapes both online and offline worldsâ€”especially in areas like digital marketing, software development, and system design.
